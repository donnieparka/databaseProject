Database project is a simple console app built for the sake of learning C.

Create file:
employeesDb -n -f DbFile

Open file:
employeesDb -f DbFile

Flags
-n = new file
-f = filepath
-a = add one employee
-l list employees
-h update hours
-r remove 1 employee
-----------------------

Employee struct:
Name:
Address:
hours:

when you remove them it will say something bad about them like:
Get ready to your new underground life. Sorry i meant underbridge.
