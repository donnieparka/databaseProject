Database project is a simple console app built for the sake of learning C.

Create file: <br>
employeesDb -n -f DbFile

Open file: <br>
employeesDb -f DbFile

Flags <br>
-n = new file <br>
-f = filepath <br>
-a = add one employee <br>
-l list employees <br>
-h update hours <br>
-r remove 1 employee <br>

Employee struct: <br>
Name: <br>
Address: <br>
hours: <br>

when you remove them it will say something bad about them like: <br>
Get ready to your new underground life. Sorry i meant underbridge.
